# Concurrency With Groovy

## Slides

Slides are in concurrent-groovy.odp or concurrent-groovy.pdf.

## Examples

All examples are designed to be run with the groovy script interpreter. Simple `cd` to the correct directory and execute `groovy <script_name>` to see the script in action. Scripts have only been tested with groovy 2.4.7, but earlier versions will probably work as well. JDK 8 is necessary as some of the examples use Java Streams.
